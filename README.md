# mb64-parser
Multipurpose tool intended to work with Mario Builder 64 level files. Potentially unstable, and I am not responsible for any damage done to level files.

# roadmap
- [ ] Parse full header data (Currently partial)
- [ ] Parse tile data
- [ ] Parse object data
- [x] Modify level title, author
- [x] Modify painting thumbnail
- [ ] Extended metadata modification

## Level
- [ ] Reconstructing level geometry
- [ ] Reconstructing level UV
- [ ] Reconstructing object placement
- [ ] Exporting generated level model
- [ ] Mesh optimization (Likely through greedy mesh algo or similar)
